 SMS Spam Classification
This project focuses on detecting spam messages using Machine Learning. It classifies SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) based on text analysis. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and uses TF-IDF vectorization along with a Logistic Regression classifier for prediction.

🔹 Key Features
✔️ Preprocessing – Text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal
✔️ Feature Extraction – TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transformation
✔️ Model Training – Logistic Regression for classification
✔️ Spam Detection – Predicts whether an SMS is spam or not
✔️ Model Deployment – Pickle file for easy reuse and deployment

 Technologies Used
:Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn)
:NLTK (for text preprocessing)
:TF-IDF Vectorization
:Logistic Regression
